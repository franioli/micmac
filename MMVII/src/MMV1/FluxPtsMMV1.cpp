/** \file  FluxPtsMMV1.cpp
    \brief file for using MMV1 flux; converting them a vect of point

    MMV1 has a very powerfull and elegant image processing toolbox (maybe I am not 100% objective ;-)
    MMVII will probably not have this kind of library (at leats in first version) as it  quite
    complicated to maintain and understand. By the way,  for many filter as long as I do not know
    exactly what I want, it's much faster to implement them with MMV1.
